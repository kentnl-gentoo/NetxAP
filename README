This is an alpha release of the Net::xAP module package for perl5.

This module provides an interface to the protocol family that the
IMAP, IMSP, ACAP, and ICAP protocols are a member of.  I've included
the beginnings of the IMAP.  The IMSP, ACAP, and ICAP modules will be
following shortly.

IMAP = Internet Message Access Protocol
IMSP = Internet Message Support Protocol
ACAP = Application Configuration Access Protocol
ICAP = Internet Calendar Access Protocol

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
Think twice about using this module to modify data on a server.  I'm not
done shaking out this thing.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
The method interface is currently in an evaluation phase.  Since the
module is at an early stage of it's life, I'm not going to try too
hard to maintain backward compatability with older alpha versions.  I
am, however, going to try to make all changes to the method interfaces
before it reaches beta release.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
In case the previous two warnings weren't enough for you - the
protocols this package implements are still under development. Expect
discontinuities between this package and the protocols as they trek
towards standardness.  As of the writing this file, IMAP is a
'Proposed Standard' protocol.  ACAP and ICAP are both 'Internet
Drafts' and are subject to change at any time.  IMSP is going to be
supplanted by ACAP.  ACAP is close to becoming a 'Proposed Standard'.
ICAP is not even close to the end of it's draft stage.

To build and install the package execute the following commands:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The TODO file has a list of features which aren't present or complete
yet.

The NEWS file has summary information on the changes from release to
release.

The BUGS file has information on current implementation bugs/malfeatures.

The CREDITS file lists folks who have been particularly helpful/brave.

The current version has been developed and tested against 5.004.

Please contact me if you use this for anything non-trivial.  This is
not for permission, it's so I can get some idea of what folks are
using the package for other than trivial scripts.

Please report any bugs/suggestions to <kjj@pobox.com>.
