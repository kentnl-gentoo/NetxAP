bhahahahaha...

General:

	The documentation is still a little scruffy, but it's a
	considerable improvement over the previous release.

IMAP:

	IMAP specifies modified UTF-7 encoding for mailbox names.  The
	IMAP module currently only escape and unescapes '&'
	characters.  The encode_mailbox and decode_mailbox can be
	overridden if you write a better routine before I do (in which
	case, please toss me a copy :-).

	The parsing of response codes is looser than it should be.

	There is minimal arg checking in methods.

	Disconnections from the server aren't handle very well.

	The SASL authentication doesn't support a security layer.

	Doesn't support X* IMAP commands.

	Multiple pending commands haven't been tested.  For now, they
	should not be used.

	There is no mechanism for preventing ambiguous multiple
	pending commands.  ...more proof that multiple pending
	commands should not be used.
	
	There are several things that well-behaved IMAP clients shouldn't
	do that Net::IMAP doesn't prevent.
	
	Not all of the extensions have been tested.  Bug reports
	gleefully accepted.

	The regression tests are incomplete.

	The IMAP regression tests require UW-imapd.

	The IMAP module hasn't been tested against very many IMAP servers.

	There is minimal arg checking in IMAP command methods.
	
	There is minimal sanity checking of server responses.
	
xAP:
	The base class hasn't been completely generalized yet.

	The SASL support doesn't support an security layer.
	
	Server-initiated disconnects haven't been tested.

	The technique for handling literals works, but there are some
	pathological cases where it could break.  Most users won't have a
	problem with it.

lots more, no doubt...
