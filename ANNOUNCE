"It's not dead - it's sleeping!"				-- mpfc

This posting is to announce the availability of the second alpha
release of the Net::xAP module for perl.

It's been a long time since a version has been released, but a small
side project got in the way (ISBN: 0-201-43288-9). ;-)

The module has been posted to CPAN as NetxAP-0.02.tar.gz under my
author id (KJOHNSON) and name (Kevin_Johnson).

Net::xAP implements the client portion of the protocol substrate
present in the IMAP, IMSP, ACAP, and ICAP application protocols, hence
the name `xAP'.  A usable IMAP module is also provided.  The IMSP,
ACAP, and ICAP protocols are being worked on.

    IMAP = Internet Message Access Protocol
    IMSP = Internet Message Support Protocol
    ACAP = Application Configuration Access Protocol
    ICAP = Internet Calendar Access Protocol

The module is still in alpha release.  Think twice (maybe thrice)
about using it for anything important, particularly if modifying data
is involved.

Being an alpha release also means that nearly all aspects of the
module are subject to change until it goes to beta.  As an example,
the callback design for this release is significantly different from
version 0.01.  Trust me, it's a `good thing'(tm). ;-)

The main purpose of this release is to get feedback on the interface
and to run it through its paces.  I am keenly interested in feedback
from folks that have a non-trivial familiarity with the IMAP, IMSP,
ACAP, or ICAP protocols.

This release was developed and tested using 5.005_03.

Refer to the provided README file for additional information and
warnings.
